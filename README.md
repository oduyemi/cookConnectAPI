### CookConnectAPI Documentation

#### Overview
CookConnectAPI is a backend API designed to support a cooking-related application. It provides endpoints for user authentication, recipe management, user profiles, and interactions such as liking and commenting on recipes.

#### Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs and web applications with Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for authentication and authorization.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based image and video management platform for image uploads.

#### Features
1. **Authentication**
   - **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/register`, `/api/v1/login`
   - **Middleware**: `userAuthMiddleware`, `protect`
   - **Functionality**: User registration, login, session management using JWT, password reset via email.

2. **User Management**
   - **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/user/profile`, `/api/v1/users/:id`
   - **Functionality**: Fetching user profile, updating user information, deleting user account (admin only).

3. **Recipe Management**
   - **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/recipe`, `/api/v1/recipe/:recipeId`
   - **Functionality**: Creating, fetching, updating, and deleting recipes. Image upload to Cloudinary with recipe data storage in MongoDB.

4. **Likes and Comments**
   - **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/users/likes/:recipeId`, `/api/v1/recipe/comments/:recipeId`
   - **Functionality**: Liking recipes, adding comments to recipes.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Centralized error handling for consistent error responses.
   - Custom error messages for different scenarios like unauthorized access or internal server errors.

#### Deployment
- Deployed on a server with environment variables managed using dotenv for configuration.

#### Dependencies
- **Express.js**: Web framework.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Token-based authentication.
- **nodemailer**: Email delivery for password reset.
- **cloudinary**: Image upload and management.
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing.
- **cors**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing handling.
- **dotenv**: Environment variables management.

#### API Usage
- Detailed endpoint documentation including URL structure, HTTP methods, request parameters, request body (JSON format), and response formats (JSON).

#### Security Considerations
- Usage of JWT for secure authentication.
- Rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse.
- Validation of input data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

#### Future Enhancements
- Implementing more advanced user roles and permissions.
- Enhancing API responses with pagination and sorting options for recipe lists.
- Integration with additional external services for enhanced functionality.

#### Conclusion
CookConnectAPI provides a robust backend solution for managing recipes and user interactions in a cooking application. It leverages modern technologies and best practices to ensure security, scalability, and maintainability.

This documentation outline serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders involved in understanding, using, and extending the functionality of CookConnectAPI.
